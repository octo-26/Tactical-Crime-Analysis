# Tactical-Crime-Analysis

As part of FP20 Analytics Challenge 11, participants will build a Tactical Crime Analysis Report for a law enforcement agency that will be used for crime data analysis from multiple dimensions. 
Youâ€™ll work with simulated crime data which contains crime events, their dates, locations and types, and names, relationships, and demographic data of the involved parties. Your aim is to build interactive reports that can be used to resolve active cases, identify the relationships between suspects, victims and witnesses, and spot trends and patterns.

Technology: Power BI, Excel
Works: 
- Used API(bigdatacloud) to find the exact borough location based on longitude and latitude coordinates
- ETL data with M query & Excel
- Building a data model using the snowflake schema
